# （Hamilton剧中有个有趣的角色拉法叶公爵是法国人，所以我对美国反抗英国的斗争中法国的影响很好奇）Why does France support America's opposition to England?

France supported America in their fight against England for a few reasons. 

Firstly, France and England had a long history of conflict and rivalry, and the American Revolutionary War presented an opportunity for France to undermine England's power and gain revenge for previous defeats.

Secondly, France saw an opportunity to weaken England's global influence, which would benefit France's own power and influence.

Thirdly, France also believed in the ideals of the American Revolution such as democracy and individual freedoms, and saw America as a kindred spirit in their efforts to challenge the traditional monarchies of Europe.

Finally, France saw the opportunity of an independent America as a potential trading partner and ally, which would benefit France's commercial interests.

Overall, France saw supporting America in their struggle against England as an opportunity to pursue their own strategic and ideological interests.

# Who is Lafayette? （剧中的）拉法叶是谁？

Marquis de Lafayette, also known as Gilbert du Motier, was a French aristocrat and military officer who played a key role in both the American Revolution and the French Revolution. 

Lafayette was born in 1757 and first came to America at the age of 19 to fight in the Revolutionary War. He befriended George Washington and became a major general in the Continental Army, playing a pivotal role in the American victory at Yorktown in 1781.

After the American Revolution, Lafayette returned to France and became a vocal advocate for the Revolutionary cause, becoming a prominent figure in the French Revolution. He was a leading voice in the early, moderate phase of the Revolution, advocating for constitutional reform and the protection of individual liberties.

However, as the Revolution became more radical, Lafayette grew disillusioned with the direction it was taking and was ultimately arrested for opposing the radical Jacobin government. He was imprisoned for five years before being released in 1797.

Lafayette remained an important symbol of the American and French Revolutions throughout his life and is remembered as a champion of liberty and democracy.

翻译成中文：

Marquis de Lafayette，又名Gilbert du Motier，是一位法国贵族和军官，在美国革命战争和法国大革命中扮演了关键角色。

拉法叶于1757年出生，19岁时首次来到美国参加革命战争。他与乔治·华盛顿交友，并成为大陆军的一名少将，在1781年的约克城战役中发挥了关键作用，使美国获得了胜利。

在美国革命后，拉法叶返回法国，成为革命事业的积极倡导者，成为法国大革命的重要人物。他是革命早期温和阶段的主要代表之一，倡导宪政改革和保护个人自由。

然而，随着革命变得更加激进，拉法叶对革命的发展方向感到失望，并因反对激进的雅各宾政府而被捕。他在狱中被监禁五年后才获释。

拉法叶终身是美国和法国革命的重要象征，被记忆为自由和民主的捍卫者。

# Hamilton was born a poor child, how did he go to a prodigious school? 汉密尔顿儿时出身穷苦，后来怎么读了名校？

Hamilton was born into poverty in the Caribbean island of Nevis, and while he didn't attend a traditional "prodigious school," he did receive a good education through a combination of self-study, apprenticeships, and opportunities provided by local community leaders.

As a child, Hamilton's intelligence was recognized by a wealthy merchant, who paid for his education. He also worked as a clerk in a local trading house, where he was exposed to various commercial, legal, and financial practices. 

At the age of 16, Hamilton moved to New York to further his education and pursue his ambitions. He attended King's College (now Columbia University), and although he did not complete his degree, he continued his self-education and became fluent in French and proficient in Latin and Greek.

Hamilton's academic achievements and intellectual abilities impressed many of his contemporaries, including George Washington, who became a mentor and friend to him. Despite his difficult beginnings, Hamilton was able to achieve great success through his hard work, determination, and natural talent.

哈密尔顿出生在加勒比海上的尼维斯岛，因此他没有去过传统的名校，但他通过自学、学徒制和当地社区领袖提供的机会接受了良好的教育。

在他小时候，一位富有的商人认识到了他的才智，并为他提供了资金进行教育。他也在当地一家贸易公司担任书记，接触到各种商业、法律和金融实践。

16岁时，哈密尔顿移居纽约，继续接受教育并追求自己的抱负。他进入国王学院（现在的哥伦比亚大学），虽然没有完成学业，但他继续自学，流利地说法语并能够熟练使用拉丁语和希腊语。

哈密尔顿的学术成就和智力能力令许多同时代人印象深刻，包括乔治·华盛顿，后者成为他的导师和朋友。尽管他的起点困难，哈密尔顿通过努力、决心和天赋取得了巨大的成功。

# What does prodigious schools mean? (印象中名校的“名”是“pro-xxx”，我只记得大概的发音，所以问)

There is no such term as "prodigious schools." The word "prodigious" means remarkable or impressive, and it can be used to describe something that is exceptional in some way. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine what "prodigious schools" might refer to.

> 名校英语怎么说?

名校英语可以表达为 "prestigious English schools" 或者 "renowned English schools"。

> Prodigious schools or prestigious schools?

"Prodigious schools" and "prestigious schools" have different meanings.

"Prodigious schools" means exceptional or remarkable schools that stand out due to their excellence in academic, artistic, or athletic performance.

"Prestigious schools" refer to schools that are highly regarded, esteemed and respected for their academic reputation, faculty excellence, and success in supporting students to achieve academic and career goals.

Therefore, if you are trying to convey high academic standards, "prestigious schools" would be the more appropriate choice.

# In the context of China-America conflict in present days, what would George washington say? 在当今中美冲突的背景下，乔治华盛顿会怎么说？

It is difficult to say with certainty what George Washington would say about the current China-America conflict, as he lived in a vastly different time and context. However, we can perhaps draw some insights from his views on foreign relations and diplomacy.

Washington believed in neutrality and non-interventionism in foreign affairs, and he warned against entangling alliances and excessive involvement in foreign conflicts. He emphasized the importance of maintaining peaceful relations with other nations and encouraged diplomacy and negotiation to resolve differences.

Regarding trade relations, Washington believed in fair and reciprocal trade, advocating for the protection of American industry and the promotion of economic independence.

In the current China-America conflict, it's possible that Washington would emphasize the importance of peaceful and diplomatic relations between the two nations, encouraging the use of negotiation and mediation to resolve disagreements. He may also argue for fair and reciprocal trade policies that protect American industry and address issues such as intellectual property theft and market access.

Overall, Washington's emphasis on neutrality, diplomacy, and fair trade could provide some guidance in navigating the complex and contentious relationship between the United States and China today.

乔治·华盛顿生活在一个与现代完全不同的时代和背景，因此很难确定他对当前中美冲突的看法。然而，我们或许可以从他对外交和外交政策的看法中得到一些启示。

华盛顿坚信在外交事务中保持中立和不干涉主义，并警告过不要卷入外国冲突。他强调与其他国家保持和平关系的重要性，鼓励使用外交和谈判解决分歧。

在贸易关系方面，华盛顿主张公平和互惠贸易政策，保护美国行业和促进经济独立。

在当前的中美冲突中，华盛顿可能会强调两国之间和平和外交关系的重要性，鼓励通过谈判和调解解决分歧。他也可能会主张公平和互惠的贸易政策，保护美国产业，解决知识产权盗窃和市场准入等问题。

总之，华盛顿强调中立、外交和公平贸易的观点，为我们在处理目前复杂和具有争议的中美关系提供了一些指导。
